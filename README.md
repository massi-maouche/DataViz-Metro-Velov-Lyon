# Data-Visualization

## Description
A comprehensive data visualization project that analyzes and presents bike usage across Lyon's metro and Velov (bike-sharing) stations. Utilizing data from the Grand Lyon API, the project offers insightful visual representations to aid in understanding bike activity patterns. We tried to use a bigger timelaps (one month) but the loading of the web page takes a considerable time as well as for interacting with it.
